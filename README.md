Inspired by classic **pipe-connection games**, Drysland is a relaxing, minimalist puzzle experience where you restore the flow of a river across a parched island by rotating and reconnecting its broken segments to bring water ‚Äî and life ‚Äî back to the land.

Each level in Drysland is a procedurally generated island that gradually increases in size and difficulty.
Pipe networks are created using a simplified version of the **Growing Tree algorithm**, ensuring each puzzle is both solvable and unique.

### Level Generation

All levels in Drysland are guaranteed to be solvable. The game uses a custom adaptation of the **Growing Tree algorithm**, commonly used for maze generation.

The core idea is to ‚Äúcarve‚Äù one or more continuous paths through a fixed-size hexagonal grid, primarily using a depth-first traversal (DFS).

Once the main paths are generated, the algorithm performs a second pass to insert additional connections between blocks along the existing routes, subtly increasing the complexity without breaking solvability.

Finally, all tiles are randomly rotated to scramble the solution and form the playable puzzle.

The algorithm is configurable, the main parameters currently in use are:

- **Traversal strategy**: defines the node selection method during path carving (e.g. DFS, BFS, or hybrid approaches).
- **Grid radius**: determines the size of the hexagonal level.
- **Grid coverage**: controls how much of the grid is used to generate the main path(s).
- **Extra link probability**: chance to add additional connections between blocks during the second pass.
- **Dead-end preservation**: percentage of dead ends that are intentionally left untouched to preserve challenge and variety.

These parameters allow for fine-tuning the level structure and difficulty, and can be adjusted to explore different types of puzzle layouts. There‚Äôs room to explore more sophisticated path-building strategies.

### Graphics Settings

Drysland offers a simple toggle between Quality and Performance modes. This setting adjusts shadows, water effects, and other visual details to strike a balance between visual fidelity and smooth performance. Your preference is saved and applied automatically each time you return.

### Mobile-Friendly

Drysland is optimized for mobile devices, providing a smooth and engaging experience on smartphones and tablets. It adapts to smaller screens, ensuring easy interaction and navigation on touch interfaces.
